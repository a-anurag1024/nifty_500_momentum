# **Motivation**

Momentum is one of the most widely used signals in technical and quantitative trading. It helps identify stocks that are already moving strongly and may continue in the same direction due to investor interest, institutional flows, or emerging catalysts. However, when applied to mid and small-cap stocks, especially in markets like India, static momentum indicators often fail to capture the *reason* behind the move. This project aims to bridge that gap by combining momentum with **news sentiment**, creating a more reliable assessment system for detecting potential breakouts.

## **1. Why Track Momentum?**

Momentum indicators (RSI, MACD, moving averages, ADX, etc.) are popular because:

* They highlight **stocks showing strong trend strength**
* They help detect **early breakouts** before broad-market attention
* They offer **objective**, data-driven signals
* They can be run across large universes like the **Nifty 500**

In large-cap stocks, momentum trends tend to be smoother due to high liquidity, institutional ownership, and fewer price distortions. Therefore, static technical indicators work reasonably well.

But in **mid and small-caps**, relying on static momentum alone becomes unreliable.

## **2. Why Momentum Gives False Signals in Mid/Small Caps**

Mid-cap and small-cap stocks often behave very differently from large caps:

### **1. Higher Volatility**

Daily price swings of 5–10% are common, causing indicators like RSI or MACD to trigger frequently, often without a sustainable trend behind them.

### **2. Lower Liquidity & Higher Impact Cost**

A few large orders can move the price significantly, generating "momentum" that is not reflective of real investor demand.

### **3. Operator or HNI-Driven Activity**

Small caps are more susceptible to short-term manipulation, circular trading, or pump-and-dump behavior, all of which can artificially inflate momentum signals.

### **4. Short-Lived Spikes**

Static screeners detect "green candles," but many of these moves fade quickly if there is no fundamental catalyst supporting them.

### **5. Momentum Without Context**

Technical indicators only observe price and volume, they provide no insight into *why* a stock is moving.

Because of these factors, static momentum approaches often generate **false positives** in the mid/small-cap segment, which reduces reliability and leads to poor risk-adjusted outcomes.

## **2. How News Sentiment Helps Build Better Momentum Assessment**

Momentum becomes **far more meaningful** when combined with the *reason* behind the move.

Most mid and small-cap breakouts occur due to:

* Earnings surprises
* Order wins
* Government policies
* Management commentary
* Sector-wide shifts
* M&A rumours
* Regulatory actions
* Promoter buying/selling

These are **news-driven catalysts** that do not appear in static indicators.

By incorporating **news sentiment**, we can:

### **1. Validate Momentum**

If the price is rising *and* the news flow is positive, the momentum is more likely to sustain.

### **2. Identify Catalyst-Backed Breakouts**

A breakout backed by strong news sentiment often leads to multi-week or multi-month trends, much more reliable than a technical spike.

### **3. Filter Out "Fake" Moves**

If momentum appears without any catalyst, sentiment analysis helps identify whether the move is:

* News-driven
* Speculative
* Manipulated
* Noise

This drastically reduces false positives.

### **4. Understand Sector Context**

News often highlights **sector-level re-ratings**, which greatly influence mid- and small-cap moves.

### **5. Make Momentum Explanatory, Not Just Reactive**

Instead of just detecting *that* a stock is moving, a sentiment layer helps determine *why* it’s moving, the core idea behind this project.

# **Conclusion**

Momentum alone is powerful but incomplete, especially in the mid/small-cap segment where price behavior can be misleading. By integrating **news sentiment analysis**, this project transforms static momentum signals into intelligent, context-aware assessments.

This allows the system not only to detect breakouts, but also to **investigate the underlying reason**, making it significantly more reliable, insightful, and aligned with real-world market behavior.
